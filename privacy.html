      <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
      <p>
        At Guteflix, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
        This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding it.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Guteflix does not require users to register or share personal data to browse the site. 
        However, we may collect non-personal information such as browser type, device, or 
        anonymous usage statistics to help improve performance.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        Guteflix may use cookies to enhance user experience — for example, to remember preferences 
        or improve page loading times. You can disable cookies in your browser settings if you prefer.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Data</h2>
      <p>
        Some movie information or images displayed on Guteflix are provided by external sources
        such as The Movie Database (TMDb). These third-party services may have their own privacy policies,
        and we encourage users to review them.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable steps to protect our website and users from unauthorized access, 
        modification, or disclosure of information. However, please note that no online platform 
        can guarantee 100% security.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Links to Other Websites</h2>
      <p>
        Guteflix may contain links to other websites or services. We are not responsible for the 
        privacy practices of those external sites.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Your Consent</h2>

        By using Guteflix, you consent to this Privacy Policy and to the collection and use of 
        information as described here.
