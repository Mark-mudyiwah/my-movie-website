      <h2>Welcome to Guteflix</h2>
      <p>
        Guteflix is your go-to movie discovery platform — built for everyone who loves cinema. 
        From trending blockbusters to hidden indie gems, Guteflix helps you explore movies 
        across all genres, languages, and styles. Whether you’re into heart-pounding action, 
        mind-bending sci-fi, or deep emotional dramas, there’s something here for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        We aim to make discovering movies simple, stylish, and fun. 
        Every title includes posters, overviews, ratings, and release details — 
        so you always know what to watch next. Guteflix was designed to look and feel 
        like a real streaming platform, while also serving as a learning project 
        in web development and backend systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At Guteflix, our mission is to bring together creativity and technology. 
        The goal isn’t just to list movies — it’s to build a beautiful interface 
        that connects people with stories they’ll love. We’re always working on new 
        features like personalized recommendations, trailers, and user reviews.
      </p>

      <p>
        The website is powered by modern technologies including 
        <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, 
        and <strong>Node.js</strong> for backend functionality. 
        Over time, Guteflix will continue to evolve into a complete 
        entertainment discovery platform.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Guteflix started as a small coding practice project — an idea to combine 
        design, logic, and passion for movies. What began as simple HTML pages 
        has grown into a full movie site experience with dynamic data, API integration, 
        and responsive layouts that work smoothly on mobile devices.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Guteflix continues to grow, we’re focused on improving speed, design, 
        and user experience. Each update brings us closer to creating something 
        that looks professional and functions like a real movie platform.
